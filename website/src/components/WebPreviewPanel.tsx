/**
 * WebPreviewPanel — a docked, session-scoped **live web preview** of a URL the
 * user is serving locally (a dev server / static server for the project they're
 * working on).
 *
 * Opened from the side panel's + menu ("Browser"), it loads the URL in a
 * sandboxed iframe. It ALSO hosts the agent-browse surface, with two transports
 * chosen by where the browser runs: when a native Chromium view is available
 * (Electron shell) it OWNS the panel (`nativeOpen`) — a chat-opened page lands
 * in the real, human- and agent-operable browser; otherwise (remote gateway /
 * plain browser) the Playwright CLI's own loopback dashboard is framed
 * (`showBrowserView`, driven by `useBrowserView`). Unlike the native view, that
 * one is served by another process — but it is NOT read-only: the CLI dashboard
 * carries its own tab bar, navigation and full remote mouse/keyboard input, so
 * the frame is the control surface and nothing may be layered over it.
 * On that second transport the address bar is also how a human opens a REAL
 * website: an external host cannot render in the iframe (sites refuse to be
 * framed, and the dashboard CSP refuses to frame them), so `commit` hands it to
 * the gateway (`POST /api/browser/open`), which opens it in the gateway host's
 * Playwright CLI browser and the panel shows that through the CLI view — whose
 * own URL bar, tab bar and input then carry the navigation from there.
 * The dev-server iframe is a real embedded browser view: the dev server's own
 * HMR live-reloads it as the user edits, and Reload covers static servers.
 *
 * Session-scoped: the chosen URL is remembered PER chat slot (`sessionKey`), so
 * each session keeps its own preview target. The dev-server preview is
 * frontend-only — no gateway round trip; the browser fetches the URL directly,
 * so only servers reachable from the user's browser (localhost dev servers) can
 * be previewed. The launcher above is the one gateway round trip, and only for a
 * non-loopback host.

 *    top-level navigation is not bound by the dashboard CSP). `127.0.0.1` is the
 *    same loopback and IS admitted, so canonicalize `[::1]`/`::1` to it. This runs
 *    independent of the dashboard host — even when it is unknown — because the CSP
 *    gap has nothing to do with cookie isolation.
 *
 * 2. **Cookie isolation.** Cookies are scoped by host but NOT by port, so an
 *    iframe pointed at `http://localhost:5173` while the dashboard is served from
 *    the same host (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or a `*.localhost` alias like
 *    `kirocrew.localhost`) would send the dashboard's host-scoped auth cookie to
 *    the previewed dev server (which could read/replay it). When the preview host
 *    matches the dashboard host and both are loopback, swap it to a
 *    guaranteed-distinct loopback host (`127.0.0.1`, or `localhost` when the
 *    dashboard already IS `127.0.0.1`) — a different host string, so no dashboard
